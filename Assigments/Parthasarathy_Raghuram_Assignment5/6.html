<ul>
<li>Kenya Tembo is big, bold and bright. </li>
<li>It has a rich buttery body that holds up well to the powerful, bright acidity. </li>
<li>It has distinctive cedar aromatics with a sharp grapefruit like citric acidity and currant fruitiness with notes of caramel. </li>
<li>Crisp and complex with a balanced aftertaste. </li>
<li>Itâ€™s a wonderful coffee and easily meets the elevated standard for which Kenyan coffees are famous.</li>
